The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:

`Abstraction:` Only showing necessary details to the user
`Encapsulation:` Hiding data from unauthorized access
`Inheritance:` A derived class has all the members of its base class
`Polymorphism:` A subclass provides its own implementation of a method defined in its superclass
`Other pillars of OOP include:` Hierarchy, Persistence, Concurrency.

`OOP` is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to design and structure code
